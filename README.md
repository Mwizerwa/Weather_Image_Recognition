# Weather_Image_Recognition

In this project, I utilized a comprehensive weather image recognition dataset, employing the ResNet101 pre-built model to enhance accuracy and efficiency in categorizing diverse weather conditions. The initiative, serving both as a valuable learning experience and a significant contribution to meteorology, aimed to advance the field of weather analysis. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically ResNet101, the project focused on improving weather pattern recognition. It's crucial to note that this was primarily undertaken for educational purposes, emphasizing that the outcomes are intended for academic exploration. Practical weather-related decisions should always be consulted with meteorological experts.

#### How to run the code
In Google Colab, replace the {"username":"------------", "key":"------------------"} part with your Kaggle username and API key. This will allow you to authenticate with your Kaggle account and access the dataset for downloading it to your Google Drive.
